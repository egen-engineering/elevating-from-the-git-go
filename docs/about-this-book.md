# About this book

This book is organized into 2 broad themes:

- **Principles** are all about the mindset we adopt while approaching problems. They in-turn, help shape up patterns.

- **Patterns** are emerging and growing archetypes that shape up in an organic way via principles. They serve as a **map** when we explore novel yet comparable circumstances ðŸ§­.

Each of these categories have their own set of sub-sections nested under them. You can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to either section and read more on that topic. Together, these talking points help us germinate seeds of thought, and help us cultivate fresh ideas into cutting-edge solutions.

## How to read

You may choose to read the chapters sequentially, or just skip to specific parts of the book if necessary.
