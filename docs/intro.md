# About

This book is divided into 2 sections - **principles** and **patterns**.

Principles are all about our mindset. Patterns are emerging and growing archetypes that shape up in an organic way, that work as a map when we explore novel yet comparable circumstances.

Together, these help us germinate seeds of thought and fresh ideas, and cultivate them into cutting-edge solutions. This book is a constant work-in-progress and evergreen, continuously shaped and refined by our learnings as we work with you.
