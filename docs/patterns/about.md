# About

How do we best re-use information and ideas gained from experience?

A tempting technique for sharing and adopting knowledge across multiple projects is by relying on *plug-and-play* solutions ðŸ§©. With this, each new project is merely an *instance* of this template, and would come packed with important, must-to-have features that the project needs. *Easy-peasy*.

**Or is it?** ðŸ¤”

Building and using templated solutions or "starter kits" isn't without challenges. Here are just a few of many issues to deal with:

- Who owns the templates?
- How do you find bandwidth to maintain and update templates?
- How flexible are templates for new projects?

With templates, a business might be forced to use a solution that isn't quite flexible enough to converge on their specific needs. It ends up being too concrete, too early. The right approach would be to kick-off with something rough and foundational, iteratively made more precise by engaging in productive conversations. That's where **patterns** come in handy.

:::info
Patterns are higher levels of abstraction that are *neither too vague, nor too concrete*. This helps us figure out what the overall solution looks like, while leaving enough room for customization.

Referring to patterns allow us to work towards modernization while also following the principle of DRY - [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). In this section, you'll see how we design and develop cloud-native solutions for our customers by relying on patterns that we frequently come across. This way, the focus isn't on *reinventing the wheel*, but rather on *how to invent a better wheel*.
