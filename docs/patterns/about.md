# About

Is there a way to re-use knowledge and ideas that we've gained from experience? There are various approaches to do so!

A highly tempting way to share and adopt knowledge across multiple projects is by relying on *plug-and-play* solutions. With this, each new project would an merely an instance of this plug-and-play, and would come packed with important, must-to-have features that the project needs.

But building such templated "*out-of-the-box*" solutions has its own set of challenges:

- Who owns the templates?
- How do you find bandwidth to maintain and update templates?
- How flexible are templates for new projects?

With templates, a business might be forced to use a solution that isn't quite flexible enough to converge on their specific needs. So we rely on **patterns** - higher levels of abstraction that's neither too vague, nor too concrete. This helps us understand what the overall solution looks like, while leaving enough room for customization.

Referring to patterns allow us to strike a balance between modernization while also following the principle of DRY - [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). In this section, you'll see how we design and develop cloud-native solutions for our customers by relying on patterns that we frequently come across. This way, the focus isn't on *reinventing the wheel*, but rather on *how to invent a better wheel*.
