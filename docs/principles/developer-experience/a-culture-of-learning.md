# A culture of learning

Finding great developers is just one part of the equation.

## During project on-boarding

Acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to become effective is crucial before embarking on a project.

So while we're continuing to have conversations with our clients and sizing up needs, our crew of engineers aren't holding back twiddling their thumbs! instead, they're working through a series of **training programs** that help them further fine-tune their tech skills. These programs are carefully designed in-house to closely reflect the kind of projects we work on.

As our early client discussions reach their high points, our engineers are already well-equipped with a solid understanding of how to apply technical knowledge **within the context of individual projects**.

## Achieving excellence

In the ever-changing landscape of tech, any developer who cares about building great products is eventually going to brood over the affair of staying up-to-date.

From time-to-time, we also guide our engineers through technical certification preparations for some of the most sought-after technologies on the market.
