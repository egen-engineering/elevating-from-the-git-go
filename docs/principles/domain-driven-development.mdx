# Domain-driven development

In a nutshell, domain-driven design is about applying technical expertise and best practices to a domain or an industry.

In the world of data, precision and recall are two important factors used to measure performance. Our experience has taught us that they are equally important in the area of business.

Over the years, we've carved a niche in the retail and healthcare sectors, that allow us to practice domain-driven design in our engineering processes. This involves putting together vast amounts of technical knowledge, identifying and recalling patterns and mental models, and formalizing them via processes.

> Every creative project starts as an imitation. You begin by mapping what you already know or have previously seen onto the situation. But if you iterate and recombine enough, it becomes an original.

## What does that mean for you?

<FeatureShowcase />

<!-- 1. Recall: Our domain knowledge enable us to evaluate requirements with a fine-toothed comb and recognize patterns that we've seen before.
2. Precision: Our technical expertise allows us to know and use the right set of technologies in-order to build features.
3. Prediction: There's no substitute for experience! It allows us to anticipate what challenges lie ahead. -->
