        Hello there, reader! ðŸ‘‹
        </p>
        <p>
        You've seen our pitch, and now you want a headstart on your game. However, your intuition tells you that pursuing
business value isn't so easy! Naturally, a train of thoughts enter your head, all of which can be condensed to:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <b>How do we start building right from the word "go!"?</b>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        In that burning question lies a complex set of challenges, that we at Egen recognized early on as we grew our team
amidst an ever-expanding portfolio of enthralled customers. Our principle has always been unequivocally the same -
"delight our partners". It is that principle upon which our strong foundation of knowledge and processes have been
polished and refined over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a founder, CTO, project manager or a developer - these principles and patterns will help you understand
          how we identify and tackle business-problems and help our customers <b>win the first-to-market race</b>.
        </p>
      </main>
    </Layout>
  );
